Hello, I am Manish Singh. I created a Netflix clone project using HTML and CSS. In this project, we used a variety of HTML 
tags and CSS properties to closely replicate the design and functionality of the original Netflix interface. The project 
involved creating a responsive layout with multiple sections, including a header, features section, FAQ, and footer. We
used flexbox for layout management, applied gradients and background images, and incorporated interactive elements 
like buttons and forms. The goal was to provide a seamless and visually appealing user experience similar to that of 
Netflix..
